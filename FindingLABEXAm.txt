The problem was about classification we have different algorithm for 
classification problem but I use decision tree, and also for binary 
classification logistic is the best choice:
•	Because decision tree can handle both categorical and numerical data.
•	It is used for both classification and regression problem.
•	And I kept the max depth=5.
•	decision tree also does not take much time as compare to randomForest,xgboost.
